		<p>Hi, my name is Brad Touesnard. I’m the founder of Delicious Brains Inc. We make super awesome products for WordPress. The "we" is currently Ian Jones, Jeff Gould, Gilbert Pellegrom, Iain Poulson, Ashley Rich and myself. Each team member is a full-time developer but also takes a share of the work of supporting our customers.</p>

		<p>We put a lot of effort into making sure our products are a pleasure to use, which means very few bugs and all the details are just right. We're looking for someone who recognizes the value in this and is passionate about building an awesome product and owning the little big details. If this piques your interest, you should consider the opportunity below.</p>

		<p>I personally review and filter all applications myself.</p>

		<h2>Position: Developer</h2>

		<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Collaborate with the team, working on all of our current WordPress plugins including WP Migrate DB Pro, WP Offload S3, and their addons</li>
			<li>Work on building new WordPress plugins, new addons for existing plugins, and possibly a SaaS app</li>
			<li>Help handle support requests from customers</li>
			<li>Engage with the WordPress community by writing blog posts, tweeting, contributing to WordPress core, and contributing to the WP.org repository</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Advanced programming skills
			<li>If you aren't an expert WordPress plugin developer or PHP developer, that's ok. But you should be an expert developer in something. I'm looking for a developer with good judgment and attention to detail, who loves tackling challenging problems, and is eager to experiment and learn. Maybe you even consider yourself a Python or Ruby programmer.
			<li>Superb English communication skills (spoken and written)
			<li>Very good front-end development skills
			<li>Self-motivated and work well independently
			<li>Meaning you don't need to be nudged every step of the way and are proactive in tackling things that need to be done without direction.
			<li>Comfortable working remotely (we don't have an office)
			<li>Experience using git
		</ul>

		<h3>Nice-To-Have</h3>
		<span>These points are not really important, but are definitely a plus.</span>
		<ul>
			<li>Experience developing WordPress plugins or themes
			<li>Experience developing PHP/MySQL apps
			<li>System administration skills
			<li>UX and design skills
			<li>Computer Science degree or equivalent
			<li>Location Independent
		</ul>

		<p>Work from wherever you're happiest. We're distributed across the globe, working from our homes in Nova Scotia, California, New Zealand, and the UK.</p>

		<h3>You Choose Your Schedule</h3>
		<p>What's your ideal schedule? Maybe you like the regular 9am-5pm schedule. Or maybe a 4-day work week is your thing. Or maybe you prefer to work 6-days per week, but less each day. Or maybe it changes week-to-week.</p>

		<p>It really doesn't matter as long as it's at least 32 hours per week and you put in the time we agree upon.</p>

		<h3>You Choose Your Benefits</h3>
		<p>What's an attractive benefits package? Well, it really depends on the person. What do you value?</p>

		<p>Maybe a Silicon Valley competitive salary is what you're after. Or maybe you really value vacation time and would rather less pay and more vacation days. Maybe health coverage is important to you, or maybe you're already covered.</p>

		<p>Because everyone values things differently, I'm leaving this wide open. Carte blanche. I'm certain we can work out an arrangement you'll be very happy with.</p>

		<h3>Company Retreat</h3>
		<p>The entire team was flown into Miami for a company retreat in May 2015. Food/drink and accommodation were covered. Check out the blog post for photos and details. We plan to do a similar trip in 2016, probably around LoopConf.</p>

		<h3>Hiring Process</h3>
		<p>If I short list your application, we'll have a discussion via email, answering each others questions. If that works out, then I'll ask you to start working part-time on our products as a member of the team. There's no better way for you to see if you like the work and for us to see if you're a fit.</p>

		<p>This part-time period could be as short as 3 weeks, but certainly no longer than 12 weeks. Depends mostly on how much time you can put in daily during the trial. If everything is working out great, then you'll be offered a full-time position.</p>

		<h3>How to Apply</h3>
		<p>Please send a well written, concise email to work @ our domain name telling me about yourself...</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Where you’re from</li>
			<li>Your programming experience</li>
			<li>Your work with WordPress (if any)</li>
			<li>Have you previously worked remotely? Tell me about it.</li>
